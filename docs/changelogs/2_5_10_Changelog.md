2.5.10
--------------
## Preface:

Nothing has changed about anything I wrote in the 2.5.9 changelog preface. If you haven't read that, I suggest you do. That said, there was a very strange bug found exclusively when using hardware that could randomly crash when opening the start menu, and that is obviously unacceptable. The other bugs were extremely minor and could've been left unpatched, but hey - if I'm already here...might as well.

## Quality of Life:

Between shinies and powerful auras, there's no shortage of unique battle start messages. That said, as I've watched people play the game, there's one combination of DVs that always gets fanfare when it happens to come up. As a direct result, I've chosen to highlight it in game as well. 

 - A quick animation and message will play when finding a species with all zero DVs. Soft resetting will also be locked until the battle starts, like shinies are.

## Fixes:
 - Fixed start menu crashing under odd hardware circumstances when playing on certain hardware
 - Fixed Daycare menu account not printing correctly during the Bug Catching Contest
 - Kenya's reset status will now be properly displayed by the Dex
 - Fixed Morty's Set 11 introduction text being incorrect
 - Fixed a minor issue with some of Fibbef's text
 - Pigy oinking outside of the box should be fixed, but it's up to him.
