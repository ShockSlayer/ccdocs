2.5.5
--------------
**Preface:**

Backend stuff. Battle Tutor updates. Minor fixes. Maybe 2.6.0 is happening later this year - you'll just have to wait and see.

**Quality of life:**

 - The Modification Station can now be accessed from Ace Trainer HQ 2F.

 - Reworked Battle Tutor menu to use the same interface as the Egg and Future tutors.

**Battle Tutor Changes:**

A bunch of things have changed for our ever-growing competitive scene - I'm sure there will be a writeup on all of that later by someone who knows more than I do. However I will mention the following changes because of the relevancy to other gameplay elements:

 - Gligar, Koffing, and Weezing now get Defense Curl via TM. This is also detected properly by the Legality Fixer NPC for transferring.

 - In some cases the Battle Tutor could teach earlier evolution family members HM moves that later evolutions got, but not the other way around. Now you can always teach the full family using the Battle Tutor if you want to.
 
Lastly, as part of the data structure rework, alphabetization has gone out the window; however now any new moves gained by an evolutionary family member are always listed first, so we can pretend it's a feature. Thanks!

**Fixes:**

 - Fixed Beth using the wrong sprite in the Underground Path and on Route 40
 - Fix trying to print blank move slots on HSL screen
 - Fix visual bugs when flying from surf pika, and falling through a hole onto surf pika.
 - RYAN is now RAIN.
