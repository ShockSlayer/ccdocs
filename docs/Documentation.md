**- Preface -**
===============

This is the main documentation page, designed to detail the majority of new features in the game, without spoiling the entirety of it. Most things are written in the context of having played Gen 2, so if you haven't played it before, then some features may be more difficult to understand.

There's a lot of very minor changes that aren't going to be covered here. [Changelogs](Changelogs.md) will have details on a per-patch basis, but you are encouraged to play the game and discover what Crystal Clear has to offer on your own!

If you're looking for more specific information, [the index](index.md) may have what you're looking for. Throughout this document, there will be hyperlinks to other sections of the documentation, which may contain light spoilers, so be aware.

Last but not least, before asking a question in the Discord, please **use the search feature.** A lot of things have been covered in the documentation, FAQ, and discussions in the server. Help us help you.

	 * See: [Map changes and additions](#map_changes)

 - A **Fast Ferry** service has been added for quick traveling without the need of HMs

	 * This is also reflected on the nickname screen
 - Egg sprite on the party screen will show shininess (blue instead of the default red)
 - Soft-reset is disabled when a shiny is initially found on the nickname screen or in battle.
	 * Note that this won't stop you from exiting or advancing text, which re-enables the ability to soft-reset.
 - When a shiny is found in battle, an "Oh, it's a shiny!" message will display. This includes Quick Encounter, to put an extra A button press between re-enabling soft resetting.
 - Sweet Scent takes repel into consideration
 - Certain gifts/events will prompt you to "Save game for soft resetting?"
	 * This sets up a nicer soft-reset point allowing you to skip dialogue/cutscenes.
	 * Encounter-based soft-reset loops can be broken out of by holding UP+SELECT.
 - Quick Continue allows you to minimize time between resets for shinies
 - Quick Encounter speeds up the startup battle animation times
 - Roamers now have a different palette and play the sparkle sound when being released
	 * Each roamer has shininess rolled for individually at the Burned Tower
	 * If Suicune is released from the Burned Tower as any set of shiny DVs, the stationary encounter will automatically be upped to the highest possible shiny DVs and will remain shiny even through resetting.
	 * If not, shininess can still be reset for at the Tin Tower event or the Cianwood City rechallenge.
	 * Shiny palettes are preserved for all overworld story events for all three beasts
	 * If a shiny roamer is fainted, when re-released, it will stay shiny (see: [E4 Resets.](#e4_resets))
	 * DVs are viewable in the Dex after enabling it from the Dex options.
 - Shinies will no longer flee
	 * This does not include roaming legendaries, who retain shininess even if they flee
 - Cannot run from shinies
	 * *(No, this was not a feature in Crystal, that was only for the stationary Red Gyarados encounter)*
 - Damaging moves will now fail if used by wild shinies
	 * This includes moves like Explosion, Curse, Take Down etc.
	 * This includes being confused, which won't proc. 
	 * Hi Jump Kick still works, but will not cause damage if it misses
	 * Struggle will continue to harm the wild shiny until it reaches red HP. It will then fail until you run out of balls, at which point it will work as normal to prevent a softlock
 - Perish Song always fails for wild species
 - If the Daycare Man has a shiny egg, he will be distracted by the blue spots
 - Legendary Beasts now have a full shiny animation which plays if they are released as shiny.
 - Suicune's DVs roll before the battle starts in the Tin Tower allowing for the proper palette and animation to play in the overworld.

### Increased odds:
 - Safari Zone and National Park (including the Bug Catching Contest) have their shiny odds increased by way of additional rerolls. See: [Chaining](#chaining)
 - Gifts (Like the Starter, Game Corner prizes, etc.) have been increased to **1/1024.**
 - Certain stationaries have increased odds to **1/1024.** This affects:
	 * Grullo Gorge - Aerodactyl
	 * Ice Path B3F - Piloswine
	 * Mount Mortar Peaks - Togepi
 - All other stationaries retain the **1/8192** chance.

================
[(Youtube Video Breakdown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=femz1MF5ra8 "Chaining")

Chaining is a new feature as of [2.2.0](changelogs/2_2_0_Changelog.md), and is designed to be comparable to Gen 2's breeding odds in terms of how accesible it makes shinies or a desired set of DVs. It is available from the start, and is linked to a new key item given to the player called the Dex Tracker.

### What is chaining?
Chaining is the concept of defeating the same wild species repeatedly, to increase the odds of finding a shiny, or maximum DVs, of that species. There are many different interpretations of this across the series, however the one in CC is a fairly unique. Watching the video linked above is a good idea to get started, and the latest information will always be listed either here or in the [changelogs.](Changelogs.md)

### Starting and maintaining a chain:
 - Chaining is disabled by default, and must be enabled by using the Dex Tracker. This can even be done during battle.
 - A chain is created when a wild species is defeated. This includes stationary/legendary encounters, excluding roamers.
 - Defeating more of the currently chained species will increase the chain.
 - Breaking a chain can only be done by defeating a different species. This means you can run away, catch other species, or travel to different areas without breaking the chain. The current chain is also saved to the save file, so you can resume it between sessions. You can also break a chain manually using the Dex Tracker.
 - Disabling chaining using the Dex Tracker will not break the chain. This can be used to preserve a chain for later.
 - Chains can be started by interacting with footprints. These chains will start at a default of 25 encounters, making it much easier to find that species.
 - When a chain is active, you will be more likely to find encounters with that same species. (See: [Encounter Rate Rerolls](#encounter_rate_rerolls))

### Rerolls and bonuses:
"Rerolls" are best described as additional number rolls that happen when DVs are generated, and if the extra rolls generate a shiny, the game will stop rolling and use that. However, in CC they function more like a "bonus counter" as they are used in a variety of other ways as well. As the chain builds, more rerolls will become available at certain milestones. The following table shows the progression, as well as the maximum amount including bonus rerolls, which are explained below. In addition, when a milestone is crossed in game, a small animation will play.

**Reroll Milestones:**

| Encounters       | Rerolls |
|------------------|---------|
| Less than 5      | 0       |
| 5                | 1       |
| 25               | 2       |
| 50               | 3       |
| 75               | 4       |
| 100              | 5       |
| 125              | 6       |
| 150              | 7       |
| 175              | 8       |
| 200              | 9       |
| 250              | 10      |
| Completed Dex    | 11      |
| Beat E4 Rematch  | 12      |
|                  | 13      |
| Safari/Park (+2) | 14      |

 - Bonus rerolls are _only_ used when calculating DVs. They are applied regardless of chain status, however chaining _must_ be enabled to take advantage of them. They will be shown when using the **CHECK** function of the Dex Tracker. You can unlock bonus rerolls by:
	 * Completing the Dex
	 * Beating the E4 Rematch

 - Visiting the Safari Zone or National Park (including the Bug Catching Contest) will add an additional **2** bonus rerolls as well.

 - After 5 encounters, wild species will have one random egg move. If the species has less than 4 moves, this will be added to their current moveset, otherwise it will overwrite the first move slot.

 - Rerolls are applied to encounter rate, but apply differently based on encounter type. Fishing, Rock Smash, and Headbutt encounters max out faster and higher since they are more cumbersome to navigate. Otherwise, the formula is <Rerolls> * 8.

**Encounter Rate Rerolls:**<a name="encounter_rate_rerolls"></a>

| Rerolls | Default Rate | Boosted Rate |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| 1       | 8            | 16           |
| 2       | 16           | 32           |
| 3       | 24           | 48           |
| 4       | 32           | 64           |
| 5       | 40           | 80           |
| 6       | 48           | 96           |
| 7       | 56           | 112          |
| 8       | 64           | 112          |
| 9       | 72           | 112          |
| 10      | 80           | 112          |

Note that encounter rate is based on the frequency of the desired species, and not the initial likelihood of finding a species when using Headbutt, Rock Smash, or while fishing.

### The Dex Tracker:
The Dex Tracker is automatically given to the player at the start of the game. It is a key item that not only can be registered for quick use on the Select button, but can also be used from the Pack in battle. The following is a description of each function of the Dex Tracker.

 - **CHECK:** Displays the species, current chain amount, and how many rerolls you currently have. 
	 * When a chain is maxed, it will display a star next to the current chain count.

 - **CLEAR:** Breaks the chain.
	 * This is mostly useful to start a new chain in the same area, without having the increased encounter rate of the old species.

 - **ENABLE/DISABLE:** Enables or disables the chaining feature.
	 * Chaining is disabled by default, and must be enabled to start tracking.
	 * Disabling a chain will not break it, meaning you can save chains for later.
	 * Disabling chaining also disables the bonus rerolls applied in special areas, returning the odds to the default 1/8192.
	 * Disabling chaining also disables the bonus egg moves after 5 encounters.
	 * Disabling chaining during battle can be done to prevent breaking a chain due to a forced or inescapable encounter.

 - **OPTIONS:** Allows configuring chain preferences.
	 * **GENDER** - If applicable, when chaining bonuses are applied, prefer MALE or FEMALE species.
	 * **POWER** - When chaining bonuses are applied, prefer a certain Hidden Power type (gender preference inclusive.)
	(Note that until the UPGRADE CARD is obtained from New Cinnabar Lab, only GENDER will be available.)

**Upgrade Card:**
	Obtained by visiting the second room of New Cinnabar Lab. Unlocks Hidden Power preference in the Dex Tracker.

### Powerful Auras:
When a species with max DVs is encountered either by chaining or randomly, a small animation will play at the start of the battle before the species cry, and a message will mention that the species is radiating a powerful aura. This is to indicate that the species either has a 15 for every DV, or if a female gender preference is set, a full set of 15s with the highest possible Attack DV.

Powerful Type Auras can also be found, if the Upgrade Card has been obtained and the Dex Tracker has been configured to search for a specific Hidden Power type. This will play _after_ the species cry - making it distinctly different from the normal Powerful Aura. In addition, the aura will have the color of the chosen type.

### Odds:
Odds are hard to calculate accurately for chaining - the internal mechanics have a lot going on which makes calculation relatively difficult. However, field testing and external simulations reveal that you are likely to find what you're looking for before you completely max out your chain odds. So don't worry about chaining being too insignificant of a buff - it's easily far more generous than other interpretations given that it aims to compete with the 1/64 chance that breeding offers. With that in mind, the following tables have been compiled. Given that rerolls are shared and that the internal mechanics include rate-based application, these numbers are best used only as a guideline.

### Interactions:
Understanding the different ways that chaining interacts with the game is important, especially for chaining certain species. There are also a variety of different niche interactions that may come up, and as such are listed below.

#### Legendaries/Stationaries/Roamers:
All of these can be chained, however this takes a little bit of extra understanding to do.
 - **Stationaries:**
	 * One-only stationaries can only be chained using SRAM Chaining. (See: [SRAM Chaining](#sram_chaining))
	 * Any stationaries that respawn when re-entering the area can also be chained by using SRAM chaining, but can also be chained normally.
	 * Stationaries with hard coded DVs like the Shiny Gyarados will not roll for shininess or DVs.
	 * Stationaries that have a bonus shiny chance will not be affected by chaining if rolled shiny.
	 * Stationaries that have bonus moves will not get egg moves.
 - **Roamers:**
	 * Cannot be chained while roaming. The stationary variants, however, can be chained after unlocking them.
	 * If released as shiny, the stationary variants will always be shiny, and must be defeated and reset to be chainable.
 - **Suicune (Tin Tower):**
 	 * If it was released as shiny, then it will always be shiny, and chaining will not affect it.
 	 * If it was not released as shiny, a 1/8192 chance will be rolled when entering Tin Tower, and if that results in a shiny, its overworld palette will show as shiny, and it will be a forced shiny encounter, and chaining will not affect it.
 	 * If it was not released as shiny and entering the Tin Tower does not roll it as one, then chaining will affect it.
 - **Suicune (Cianwood City):**
	 * If released as shiny, and defeated at the Tin Tower, it will always be shiny, and must be defeated and reset to be chainable.

#### SRAM Chaining:<a name="sram_chaining"></a>
 - Starting or increasing a chain is saved directly to the save file, *the moment it happens.* This means if you accidentally break your chain, you can't reload your save file to restore it. 
 - However, this also means if you spend resources like money or items to make chaining easier, you can reset to regain said items. This can also be used to prevent overleveling your party while chaining.
 - This is most effectively used to chain stationary encounters, like legendaries. Simply save before starting the encounter, then after defeating the species, soft reset the game. While it is safest to soft reset after returning to the overworld, it is possible to reset slightly earlier. A good point of reference is the "+1 Rerolls" animation, as this plays directly after the save file is updated, meaning it is safe to reset during the animation.

#### Sweet Scent:
Sweet Scent has a new utility - when used while a chain is active, boosts the encounter rate rerolls to the max of 80. What this means is that it can be used to quickly build up chains, and is designed for more easily starting chains of 1% encounters, since these can be more cumbersome to find just by walking, even with extra rolls active.

#### Misc:
 - The Dex Tracker can be put into the PC, and will still track chains and apply the options. This is not recommended.
